Hello, this is my first \LaTeX\ document. 
% a blank line it use to mark a hard return = new paragraph which is indented.
% and a '\\' mark a soft return = not a new paragraph but a new line ( not indented )

This is some mathematic calculations: $(x + 2)$ and $(x - 3)$.
% we use the $ sign for mark a mathematic expression ( math mode ) and we end it with another $ sign
% if one par of the math mode goes continue to the next line you can surround you math exp with the sign '{}' and it will be all in the same line.
% to make you math exp shown in display math mode you have to surround it with '\[...\]'
The equation \[{A(x)=x^2+2x-4}\] does not have a solution

One last math expression for the road: \[f(x) = 2^x {(x - 2)}^2 - \log10 - {(x -2)}^3\]
